# Function to get soil quality from an API
def get_soil_quality(latitude, longitude):
    api_key = 'your_google_maps_api_key'
    url = f'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?location={latitude},{longitude}&radius=1000&type=soil_quality&key={api_key}'
    
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    soil_quality = data['results'][0]['soil_quality']  # Example response field
    return soil_quality

# Example usage
latitude = 40.7128
longitude = -74.0060
soil_quality = get_soil_quality(latitude, longitude)
print(f'Soil Quality: {soil_quality}')
